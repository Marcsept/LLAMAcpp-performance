Given the following information about me, write a 4 paragraph college essay: I am originally from Barcelona, Spain. While my childhood had different traumatic events, such as the death of my father when I was only 6, I still think I had quite a happy childhood.. During my childhood, I changed schools very often, and attended all kinds of schools, from public schools to very religious private ones. One of the most “exotic” things I did during those years is to spend a full school year studying 6th grade in Twin Falls, Idaho, with my extended family.

I started working very early on. My first job, as an English teacher, was at age 13. After that, and throughout my studies, I worked as a teacher, waiter, and even construction worker.
